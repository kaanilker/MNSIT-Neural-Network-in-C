# MNSIT-Neural-Network-in-C
A lightweight, high-performance Neural Network implementation written in pure C to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This project avoids any high-level machine learning libraries (like TensorFlow or PyTorch), implementing every mathematical step—from forward propagation to backpropagation—using only standard C libraries.
